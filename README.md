# typedoc-plugin-mdn-links

> Supports TypeDoc 0.22.x

Adds support for linking references to global types like `HTMLElement`, `WebAssembly`, and `Date` to their documentation pages on MDN.

This is probably missing links! If you set `--logLevel Verbose`, it will print out when failing to resolve a symbol to a page on MDN. Pull requests to fix failed resolution are welcome!
